<div id="about_me">
    <p><img src="images/me.jpg">
        I started my journey in Web Design and Development two years ago with the intent of trying to make dreams
        become a reality for websites.

        I was born into a very creative family that taught me that creativity is best done through love.
        Love for the hearts desire in all things beautiful.

        Upon graduating High School, I followed my dream of serving my country in the United States Air Force,
        developing skills in computers, interpersonal relationships and learning what leadership really stood for.
        Upon being faced with a different direction, I moved towards a degree with an amazing University.
        Full Sail University opened my eyes to the wide world of Web Design and Development.
        Through the course of my time at Full Sail University, I faced frustration, determination, desire and
        ultimate sacrifices to achieve what I feel is my true direction.  I found that love of Web Design and
        Development was my true passion and desire.

        I wish to design and develop websites that are inspiring, natural and give people a sense of companionship
        within there sites.  To work with people that want to bring there hopes and dreams to light.
        To create a picture on the screen from there imagination and bring there hearts desire for success to a
        reality.  The Web Design process is awe inspiring and I find that I really love the initial phases of the
        process in working with people to get there ideas and inspirations onto paper and then further enhance there
        ideas into a reality.

        I am a mother of two wonderful children and a wife to a dedicated serviceman that has helped me throughout
        this direction that I have chosen to take.  There love and compassion for this road we have taken together
        has brought a commitment to focusing on what truly matters and that is Love.</p>
