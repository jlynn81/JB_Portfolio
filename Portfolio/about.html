    <h1>A Little bit About Me...</h1>


    <img src="css/images/about_me.jpg">
    <p> I am a mother of two wonderful children and a wife to a dedicated serviceman that has helped me throughout
        this direction that I have chosen to take.  There love and compassion for this road we have taken together
        has brought a commitment to focusing on what truly matters and that is Love.
        <br>
        Upon graduating High School, I followed my dream of serving my country in the United States Air Force,
        developing skills in information technology, interpersonal relationships and learning what leadership really stood for.
        Upon being faced with a different direction, I moved towards a Bachelors degree with an amazing University.
        <br>
        Full Sail University opened my eyes to the ever changing and challenging world of Web Design and Development.
        Through the course of my time at Full Sail University, I faced frustration, determination, desire and
        ultimate sacrifices to achieve what I feel is my true direction.  I found that my love for Web Design and
        Development was my true passion and desire.
        <br>
        I wish to design and develop user interfaces that are inspiring, natural and give people a better user experience.
        To work with people that have a true passion for increasing interpersonal interactions with technology that
        not only creates a picture on a screen from there envisioning thoughts but helps a company to provide users
        new and old that desire to stay within the website and utilize its every function.
        <br>
        The user interface design and development process is awe inspiring and I find that I really have a deep
        passion for the initial phases of the process as well as working through the process with a team of people
        to bring this idea to reality.  Working with clients to really understand what they hope to accomplish,
        going through the design and development process of producing wireframes, prototypes, mood boards/style sheets,
        into the production of the site using back-end and front-end coding is very fun and exciting!
